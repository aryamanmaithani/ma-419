This is the repository where I've posted the notes I've made for MA 419 (Basic Algebra), a course taken in Autumn 2019 by me.  
These were made for the purpose of personal use but I'm uploading them here in case someone else finds them useful. These notes are certainly not self-contained as I have skipped introduction of those basic objects/concepts which were already familiar to me. However, I still think that these are written fairly well enough for others to understand.

### [Notes.pdf](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-419/blob/master/Notes.pdf)
This is the file that contains the aforementioned notes in PDF format.
